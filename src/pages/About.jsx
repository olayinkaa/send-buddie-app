                <p className="mt-8 text-lg lg:text-2lg font-normal">
                    Sendbuddie was conceived out of an urgent desire to change the money transfer industry. We conceived
                    and developed it as an entirely new approach to remittances. Traditional means of money transfer are
                    time-consuming, expensive, and cumbersome; definitely not suitable for this generation, and we are
                    determined to change that. Sendbuddie enables people to send money online to their friends and
                    family abroad, using a computer, tablet or smart phone. Our service is cheaper, faster and more
                    convenient than the traditional alternatives.

                    You can now send money using your debit and credit cards, very much in the same way you pay for
                    goods from online shops, or you can send money by bank transfer. Your recipients will receive the
                    money directly into their bank account or mobile wallet. We are constantly thinking of new ways of
                    sending money across borders. We are committed to the introduction of innovative new technological
                    ideas in the money transfer industry. We focus all our energy on building the new so we can
                    eventually replace the old. While old systems decay and slowly die around us, we are building the
                    new, using the ashes of the old as building blocks for the next generation methodology.
