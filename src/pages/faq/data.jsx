                    Like banks and other financial institutions, SendBuddie is in compliance with strict anti-money

                    proof of address or both in order to process your transfer. Should we need this, you will be
                    notified during the payment process. You cannot use a single document source to confirm both your
                    name and address. For example, if you provide your driving licence as proof of your name you must
                    provide another form of identification for your address, such as a utility bill.
