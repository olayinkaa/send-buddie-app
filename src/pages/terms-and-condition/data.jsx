                        Your physical card (if not a virtual card and only if enabled) can be used to make cash

                        payment or cash withdrawal when using a card associated with the account. The card is intended
                        for use as a means of payment, and funds loaded onto the account do not constitute a deposit.
                        You will not earn interest on the balance of the account. The cards will expire on the expiry
                        date indicated and will cease to work. Please check clause 8 of this Agreement for further
