## Project Name
SENDBUDDIE

## About the Project

Sendbuddie was conceived out of an urgent desire to
change the money transfer industry.
We conceived and developed it as an entirely new approach to remittances.
Traditional means of money transfer are time-consuming, expensive,
and cumbersome;
definitely not suitable for this generation, and we are
determined to change that.
Sendbuddie enables people to send money online to their friends
and family abroad,
using a computer, tablet or smart phone. Our service is cheaper,
faster and more convenient than the traditional alternatives.

You can now send money using your debit and credit cards, very much
in the same way you pay for goods from online shops, or you can
send money by bank transfer. Your recipients will receive the money
directly into their bank account or mobile wallet.
We are constantly thinking of
new ways of sending money across borders. We are committed to the
introduction of innovative new technological ideas in the money
transfer industry. We focus all our energy on building the new
so we can eventually replace the old. While old systems decay
and slowly die around us, we are building the new, using the
ashes of the old as building blocks for the next generation methodology.
